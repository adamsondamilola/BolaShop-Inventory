What about trying to figure out your profit? 

All of these problems and more has been solved by BolaShop. 

BS uses product bar or qr code for making managing products and sales seamless.

Bar code and Qrcode are the most commonly used methods of uniquely identifying a product type. 
For example, WXY biscuit code is different from ABC biscuit code.
